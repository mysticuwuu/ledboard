# ledboard

This is a LED Matrix designed and made by me. It consist of 300LEDs in 20x15 pixel arrangements.
For the LEDs i am using WS2812B led strip, that will be cut in 15 piece of 20 LED each and arranged in zigzag pattern.

This is powered by a beefy powersupply of 10A atleast and the brain of the project is an ESP32 which can show different animation, data, and tons of different things.

The body is 3d printed, with acrylic diffuser. there's no need of any custom pcb, everything will be soldered or connected using jumper wire.
Image of project is attached in the files.
Thank you.
